im so disgusted with myself,leaving notes?diaries??after all that goodbyes?im such a fucking idiot,im pathetic,its just so hard to comprehend this,i dont want it to end,but i couldnt even keep my promiss to change for the better,this is so fucking stupid,im so self aware that i always second guess everything i do,like "i dont think shes gonna want to read any of this,fairly sure she just wants to get this over with"i overthink so much that most of my predictions come true, im so pissed with myself,after yesterday i was absolutely miserble, yes i wanted this to end but AT THE SAME TIME i didnt,
i dont know what to do,i really dont,im fighting with myself, "dont check on her" "check on her" "see if she still cares",why is it so hard to let go,why cant i ignore you,why,WHY?.
